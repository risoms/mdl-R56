From SR Research Forum (https://www.sr-support.com/forum/eyelink/eyelink-usage/5607-fixation-report-s-value): The EyeLink parser algorithm is based on the identification of saccades based on the velocity and acceleration of gaze during each sample. When both the velocity and acceleration thresholds are exceeded, a saccade begins. When either falls below its threshold, the saccade ends. Any samples not contained in a saccade are by definition in fixation.

From the EyeLink 1000 User Manual (pg. 98): For each data sample, the parser computes instantaneous velocity and acceleration and compares these to the velocity and acceleration thresholds.The parser will check that the saccade signal is on or off for a critical time before deciding that a saccade has begun or ended.
