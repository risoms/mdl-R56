5.0 (8/19)
- enabled 5-digit subject numbers (up to 99999)

4.0 (4/6)
- added fixation window (500msec) for each trial
-- task continues once window is met (different from pupil dilation, which waits for 2000msec)
-- if window is not met in 2000, task goes into drift correct

3.0 (2/28)
- fix timing issue: changed recorded offset for facestim to actual offset, instead of dotloc onset
i.e. Dotlockoffet to FaceStimOffset
and DotLoc.OnsetTime to FaceStim.OffsetTime

- added cresp, resp, acc variables to eyetracker data

- enabled keyboard for use during E-Run test

- logging (facestim, dotloc)
/action delay
/action time
/duration
/duration error
/start time
/finish time
/offset delay
/offset time
/onset delay
/onset time

2.0 (1/20)
- made images greyscale (1/20)
- allow participant to control task (gamepad)
- sending trial variable to dataviewer TrialVar
