# To Do
1. remove duplicates (1000.csv,1000x.csv)
1. accuracy by emotion
    - so 1) correct sad, 2) correct neutral, 3) errors
    - here we would want to know what the probe & error emotion is.
    -
2. We would need reaction times for these conditions
3. generate the means across all trials for each person
